# Workflow Automation: Real-World Use Cases That Drive Growth

In 2025, businesses are automating more than ever — and not just to save time. Workflow automation now drives growth, reduces human error, and frees up teams to focus on high-impact work.

In this article, we break down what workflow automation really means, the best tools, and real business examples of how it's used.

### Common Automations:

- Assigning new leads to sales reps based on region or service
